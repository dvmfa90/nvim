Nvim is a text editor based on VIM.

** The plugins I added

+ vifm/vifm.vim ---> Allows to bring up vifm within vim.
+ vimwiki/vimwiki ---> Plugin to create a wiki, where you can link files and
much more.
+ FZF ---> Fuzzy finder, really great to find files and other things.
+ gruvbox ---> To get a better color scheme.
+ vim-orgmode ---> Made to be similar to org mode in Emacs.
+ nvim-lspconfig ---> To use language server protocol.
+ vim-fugitive ---> To be able to use git commands out of nvim with
keybidings.
+ vim-airline ---> Provides a nice status bar for vim
+ vim-startify ---> allows you to change the vim home page, so you add
bookmarks, sessions and other stuff
+ nvim-colorizer ---> This basically finds where there are RGP color codes,
and puts the actual color of each code as the background of the color code.
+ undotree ---> This along with specific config in nvim, allows to browse
true undos you have done within a tree menu.
+ nerdcommenter ---> allows to setup a keybidings so you can easily comment
lines of code
+ auto-pairs ---> This adds automatically the pair of (), {} "" and etc.
+ nvim-compe ---> This is an auto-comeplete for vim goes along with next
